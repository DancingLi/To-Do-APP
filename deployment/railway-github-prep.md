# How to Prepare Your GitHub Account for Railway Deployment

Let's go step by step, nice and easy!

## 1. Make Sure You Have a GitHub Account

- If you don't have one, go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up.
- Ask an adult for help if you need to!

## 2. Put Your Project Code on GitHub

- Your project should be in a folder on your computer.
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and click the "+" in the top right, then "New repository".
- Give your repo a name (like `todo-checklist`).
- **Do NOT** add any passwords or secret keys to your code before uploading!
- Follow the instructions to upload your code:
  - You can use GitHub Desktop (easy) or the command line (ask for help if you need it).
  - Make sure all your project files are in the repo.

## 3. Check Your Project Structure

- Your backend (Node.js) and frontend (React) should be in the repo.
- If they are in separate folders (like `server` and `src` or `client`), that's okay!
- Make sure you have a `package.json` file in each part.

## 4. Remove Sensitive Info

- Open your `.env` file and **delete any passwords or secret keys**.
- Instead, put those in a file called `.env.example` (but leave the values blank).
- This keeps your secrets safe!

## 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

- Save all your changes.
- Use GitHub Desktop or the command line to "commit" and "push" your code to GitHub.

## 6. (Optional) Ask an Adult to Check

- If you're not sure, ask a parent, teacher, or friend to look at your GitHub repo and make sure it looks good.

## 7. You're Ready!

- Now you can go to [railway.app](https://railway.app/) and connect your GitHub account.
- Railway will help you deploy your app to the internet!

**You did it! ðŸŽ‰**
