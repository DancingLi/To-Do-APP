# Alternatives to Deploying Your To-Do Checklist App

If you're finding deployment too challenging, here are several alternatives that let you use or create to-do checklist applications without deploying code to servers:

## Option 1: Use Existing To-Do Apps

Instead of deploying your own application, you can use established to-do apps with similar features:

- **[Todoist](https://todoist.com/)** - Offers recurring tasks, priorities, and collaborative features
- **[Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/)** - Clean interface with task lists, reminders
- **[TickTick](https://ticktick.com/)** - Features task dependencies, great for complex projects
- **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)** - Customizable with database views and task relationships

## Option 2: No-Code/Low-Code Solutions

Build your own to-do app without traditional deployment:

- **[Airtable](https://airtable.com/)** - Create a custom to-do database with views and automations
- **[Bubble.io](https://bubble.io/)** - Visual programming to build a web app without coding
- **[AppSheet](https://www.appsheet.com/)** - Create mobile apps from spreadsheets
- **[Glide](https://www.glideapps.com/)** - Turn Google Sheets into custom apps

## Option 3: Local Development Only

Run your app locally on your computer:

1. Install MongoDB locally using [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Start your Node.js backend:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Navigate to your server directory: `cd e:\OneDrive\PythonTool\To-do Checklist\server`
   - Make sure you have a package.json file with a "start" script
   - Install dependencies (first time only): `npm install`
   - Start the server: `npm start`
   - You should see output indicating the server is running (e.g., "Server running on port 5000")
   - Keep this terminal window open while using the app
3. Start your React frontend:
   - Open a new terminal window (keep the backend terminal running)
   - Navigate to your React frontend directory: `cd e:\OneDrive\PythonTool\To-do Checklist`
   - If your React code is in a subdirectory, navigate to it (e.g., `cd frontend` or `cd src`)
   - Make sure you have a package.json file with necessary dependencies
   - Install dependencies (first time only): `npm install`
   - Start the React development server: `npm start`
   - Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`
   - If it doesn't open automatically, manually navigate to that URL
4. Access your app at `http://
